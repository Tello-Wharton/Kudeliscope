# Kaleidos: CSS Kaleidoscope Effects

A simple kaleidoscope effect produced with a bunch of SASS-powered
CSS rotation and scale transforms on Ged's face.

See it in action here: http://kudeliscope.com

## Parameters
You can pass parameters via the query string: e.g.
?n=13&src=http://someurl/someimage.png

* **n** is a positive integer representing the number of "segments" to
create within the kaleidoscope. The provided CSS enthusiastically
supports up to 32 segments but the effect works best with lower
values.

* **src** is a URL for an alternate image.

* Assigning a truthy value to **clean** inhibits the display of the
link to Github.

## Dedication
Dedicated to [@gkudelis](https://twitter.com/gkudelis), who has the best name ever.

## Minutiae
It's funny because Ged's second name is Kudelis, and this is a Kudeliscope... Geddit?

## TODO
* This is complete.

## Terms & Conditions
